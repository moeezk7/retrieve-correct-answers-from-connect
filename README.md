# retrieve-correct-answers-from-connect

This is a small AHK script I made. The script will go through each page of questions on a past completed assignment and retrieve the correct answers to study from. Since sometimes there would be 80+ questions, this normally would be a lengthy mundane task, but this script will automate the process.

I wanted to try my hand at creating a AHK script and this served as a great opportunity to do so.
